# UMLCreator
A JavaFX application based on the SBU CSE 219 course project using the given libraries (PropertiesManager, SimpleAppFramework, XMLUtilities, javax-json-1.0.4) from Professor Richard McKenna(https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/RichardMcKenna) that creates fully functional UML diagrams.

Despite still having the functional original version of this project, this repository is a remastering of the production to bring the code quality up to my current standards. 

# Program functions to include:
- Saving to JSON
- Loading from JSON
- Exporting UML diagram to compiling Java code
- Adding classes and interfaces
- Removing classes and interfaces
- Displaying inheritance
- Resizing classes and interfaces
- Taking screenshots of UML diagram
- Adding a grid to the background
- Ability to snap to aforementioned grid
- Moving classes and interfaces
- Adding and editing variables and methods such as the visibility and if they are static
- Zooming in and out

This is an an example of a how a parent-child relationship, variables, methods, and an API would be represented in my older version of this project:
