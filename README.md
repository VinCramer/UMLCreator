# UMLCreator
A JavaFX application based on the SBU CSE 219 course project using the given libraries (PropertiesManager, SimpleAppFramework, XMLUtilities, javax-json-1.0.4) from Professor Richard McKenna(https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/RichardMcKenna) that creates fully functional UML diagrams.
