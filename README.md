# UMLCreator
A JavaFX application based on the SBU CSE 219 course project using the given libraries (PropertiesManager, SimpleAppFramework, XMLUtilities, javax-json-1.0.4) from Professor Richard McKenna(https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/RichardMcKenna) that creates fully functional UML diagrams.

Despite still having the functional original version of this project, this repository is a remastering of the production to bring the code quality up to my current standards. 

# Program functions:
- Launching a new project
- Adding new classes
- Moving classes
- Toggleable grid in the background
- Ability to snap to aforementioned grid, even if the grid is not displayed
- Removing classes
- Taking screenshots of UML diagram

# Program functions to include:
- Saving to a JSON file
- Loading from a JSON file
- Exporting UML diagram to compiling Java code
- Adding interfaces
- Displaying inheritance
- Resizing classes and interfaces
- Adding and editing variables and methods such as the visibility and if they are static
- Zooming in and out
- Updating display depending on the currently selected class or interface
- Ability to edit nearly all features of classes and interfaces such as method and their names, return types, if they're abstract, etc.

This is an an example of a how a parent-child relationship, variables, methods, and an API would be represented in my older version of this project:
